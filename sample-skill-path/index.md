The index file of the skill path typically has the short introduction to the skill path.
It's not required, but it's a good place to mention the main topics you'll be covering in the skill path,
and what the student can expect to learn from the skill path.

Similar to other content types, the skill path can also embed images from its `__` `static` `__` subdirectory.
