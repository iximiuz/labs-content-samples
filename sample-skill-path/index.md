## What is a Skill Path on iximiuz Labs?

Skill paths are a way to organize and track the progress of a student's learning journey.
They are a collection of tutorials, challenges, and other content types that are related to a specific topic.

## How to Edit the Skill Path

The process is identical to the one described in the [Sample Tutorial](/tutorials/sample-tutorial).

## How to Control Skill Path Access

The process is identical to the one described in the [Sample Tutorial](/tutorials/sample-tutorial).

## Skill Path's Index File

The `index.md` file of the skill path typically has the short introduction to the skill path.
It's not required, but it's a good place to mention the main topics you'll be covering in the skill path,
and what the student can expect to learn from the skill path.

Similar to other content types, the skill path can also embed images from its `__st–∞tic__` subdirectory.
