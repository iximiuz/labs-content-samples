In this challenge, you will need to perform the most fundamental Docker operation - start a container.

<i>Different ways to start containers (Docker, Podman, nerdctl, ctr.)</i>
::

You can use any container image you like,
but we recommend choosing a long-running container (e.g., `nginx`)
because to complete this challenge you will also need to inspect the running container and answer a few questions about it.

::simple-task

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container
---
#active
Waiting for the container to start...

#completed
Yay! The container is running ðŸŽ‰
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 1
---

It's an easy one - `docker --help` is your friend.
::

To keep track of containers, Docker assigns a unique ID to each of them.
Can you find the ID of the container that you've just started?

::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container_id
:validate: '[[ "x(.needs.verify_container.stdout)" = "x(.input)"* ]]'
:destination: /tmp/container-id.txt
---
#active
Waiting for the container ID to be identified...

#completed
Yay! You've found the running container ID ðŸŽ‰
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 2
---

Same advice as in the previous hint - `docker --help` is your friend ðŸ˜‰
::

Now, when you have a running container, let's try to understand what it actually is.

Did you know that [Docker containers are "just" Linux processes](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/oci-containers/)?
Can you locate the main container's process? What is its PID?

::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container_pid
:validate: '[ "$(docker_container_pid x(.needs.verify_container.stdout))" = "x(.input)" ]'
:destination: /tmp/container-pid.txt
---
#active
Waiting for the container PID to be identified...

#completed
Yay! You've found the running container PID ðŸŽ‰
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 3
---

If containers are _regular Linux processes_, will they show up in `ps` or `top` output? ðŸ¤”
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 4
---

Entered a PID of a process that definitely belongs to the container, but the solution checker doesn't accept it?
One of the key Docker design principles is to run **one service per container**.
However, it doesn't mean that every container will have only one process inside.
Actually, more often than not, you'll find a whole process tree inside a container.
Try identifying the root process of that tree.
That's what the checker expects.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 5
---

Still having trouble?
You can always fall back to `docker inspect` to cross-check your findings.
::

Approximating containers to _regular Linux processes_ is helpful, but it's not very accurate.
Thinking of containers as of _boxes for processes_ might be even more helpful at times.

From inside the box, it may look like the containerized app is running on its own machine.
In particular, such a virtualized environment will have its own network interface and an IP address.
Can you find the IP address of the container that you've just started?

::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container_ip
:validate: '[ "$(docker_container_ip x(.needs.verify_container.stdout))" = "x(.input)" ]'
:destination: /tmp/container-ip.txt
---
#active

Waiting for the container IP address to be identified...

#completed
Yay! You've found the running container IP ðŸŽ‰
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 6
---

There are many ways to find the container IP address.
If you're a Linux guru, you can try your luck with `ip netns` and `ip addr`.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 7
---

Don't feel comfortable messing with Linux network namespaces?
You can always use the `docker inspect` command to find the container IP address.
